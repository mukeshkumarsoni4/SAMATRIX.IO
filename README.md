Welcome to My Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of My Deep Learning and Nerural Networks Projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
Projects
# [Project - 1  Predict Agriculture Land Price ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/SAMATRIX.IO.git)
1. Description: The project Predict Agriculture Land Price. We will predict the Agriculture land price based on two features: area of the land (in sqm) and its locality (urban or rural)
2. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses TensorFlow Estimator and LinearRegressor.
3. Results: The logistic regression gave ['predictions': array([51347.23], dtype=float32)].
   
# [Project - 2 Predict Price of the House ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/SAMATRIX.IO.git)
1. Description: The project predicts the Price of the House Predictions.
2. Technologies Used: The notebooks uses TensorFlow Estimator and Linear Regression.
3. Results: The Results of Predicted Value:  931.19324 Expected:  27.5. 

# [Project - 3 Handwritten Digit Recognition using LeNet-5 CNN Architecture on MNIST Digit Database](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/SAMATRIX.IO.git)
1. Description: The project predicts the Binary Digits of image Numbers of the MNIST Digit Database.
2. Technologies Used: The notebooks uses TensorFlow and Keras Popular Library and Sklearn-Model.
3. Results: The Final  Results Predictions of accuracy: 0.9666 - val_loss: 0.1160 - val_accuracy: 0.9652

# [Project 5 - Linear Classification - Predict Survival from a Ship mishap](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/SAMATRIX.IO.git)
1. Description : Now letâ€™s focus on building a Classification model using a real dataset, the Titanic data set. There are 627 sample cases in the training dataset and 264 cases in test dataset. 10 attributes have been assigned to each passenger
2. Technologies Used: The notebooks uses TensorFlow Estimator and Linear Regression.   
3. Results: The Final  Results Predictions of accuracy = 0.7386364, accuracy_baseline = 0.625, auc = 0.83180285, auc_precision_recall = 0.79828036, average_loss = 0.480906, global_step = 200, label/mean = 0.375, loss = 0.47387764, precision = 0.65, prediction/mean = 0.40829763, recall = 0.65656567
